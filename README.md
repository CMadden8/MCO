# MCOTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

# Installation

run npm install to install the required modules

# Setup

run ng serve to launch the app

# Notes

## CSS

1) The CSS uses the latest version of bootstrap's flexbox

2) The page was made to be responsive, but needs some clean up - the majority of the responsiveness is already there

## JSON

1) The JSON file is located in assets/mock/test/test.json

2) I've created 114 random users in the file

3) I've the post counts and the week numbers random, as they might appear in reality

## The Bar Chart 

1) I've made the axis markers dynamicly adjust to the random week numbers and post numbers, so the markers are always relevant to the current selected user

## Row Selection

I added a row selection dropdown that will add new rows to the user table, but I didn't have time to make a pager
